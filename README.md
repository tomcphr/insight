### Description
A unfinished 2d styled platformer with role playing elements.

It's not the best written as I was mostly just messing around with things, but it somewhat works!

### How to setup for development
* Either have a server with a command line interface or use `XAMPP` or something similar.
* Install `nodejs` onto the server (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Run `npm install` which will install the dependencies.
* Run `npm run compile` which will then compile the game.
